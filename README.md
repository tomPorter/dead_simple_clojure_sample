Dead Simple Clojure Sample
==========================

The newest swank-clojure jar greately simplifies running a Clojure REPL in emacs, provided that you have 
a Clojure project set up.

This is the simplest clojure project I could think of to try out the newest swank-clojure features.

Requires:

-	Leiningen

- A recent clojure-mode.el, with proper .emacs require statements.
